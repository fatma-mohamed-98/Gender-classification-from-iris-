# Problem statement:
- Gender prediction from iris recognition techniques is  widely used in human identification process which is called Biometric identification.
- As the iris of the two eyes of same individual arenâ€™t comparative, the iris recognition gives more accurate result comparing with other biometric verifications.
so, it is considered as the most accurate biometric identification system.
- The performance of iris recognition system enhanced the gender prediction from their iris images . 
- Because of its high recognition rate, the iris recognition is one of the most meticulous biometric modality.


# Work significance:
Gender information may also be useful when a person isn't recognized but is attempting to gain entry to a restricted zone. Another possible use of gender information arises in social settings, where it may be useful to screen entry to an area based on gender, while not recording the identity. Gender classification is also important for banking transactions from cellular phones, demographic information collection, marketing research, and real-time electronic marketing. It is important to note that, for enrollment, we need to search the entire database to ensure that someone is not trying to generate two identities, one male, and one female, in order to double dip. For verification, we only need to search against the target template. Therefore, the gender information may be relevant to the management of the iris datasets.
